# Wisp
Android Application for visually impaired people who can not read normal books. This app will recite users favourite book. There is no button in this app because visually impaired people can not see where the button is. We provide interface for giving command by swipping on the screen. In each view user will get voice instructions.
In short user does not need to see anything to use this app.
